# Dijkstra Algorithm

This scipt returns the optimum path for the point robot to navigate through the obstacle space.
Here we take the initial and goal state for the robot from the command line.
The first two numbers are coordiante for the intial point and the last two numbers are coordinate for the goal point.
In this scipt we use Dijkstras Algorithm for finding the optimal path.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  python3 path\to\Dijkstra-pathplanning-Usnik-Chawla.py xinit yinit xgoal ygoal
```


        
        xinit: x coordinate of the intial point
        yinit: y coordinate of the initial point
        xgaol: x coordinate of the goal point
        ygoal: y coordinate of the goal pint

    In sample run we have xinit=105 , yinit=50 , xgaol=200 , ygoal=185
